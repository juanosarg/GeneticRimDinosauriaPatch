    <description>Triceramuffalos produce a secretion from various parts of their upper digestive tract. The resulting "milk" is fed to their offspring via regurgitation, and is similar to what mammals produce; it contains similar levels of fat and protein, along with carotenoids and antibodies. Now, why would anyone want to drink this? 'Cause it's the Rim, baby!</description>
